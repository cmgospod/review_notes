Pandas! Remember Pandas? I do. I definitely do. .head(), .shape, and all that jazz.
Unit 1 Sprint 1 is basically all stuff I remember.

Unit 1 Sprint 2 is more basic stuff.
n-choose k etc
n!/(n-k)!
Student's t-test tests if two samples are from the same population
Bayes is the same as aIb/bIa = a/b
Unit 1 Sprint 3 is linalg
probably not something to worry about
numpy arrays, determinants, etc
