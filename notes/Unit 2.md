Unit 2 Sprint 1 is linear models
mean baselines! I remember those
scikit-learn is the go-to for basic stuff like this
train/test split to avoid overfitting
error measures: absolute error (duh)
ordinary least squares (minimizes squared error, so lots of small errors are nbd)
R^2: proportion of the variance in y that is explained by x
unlike the others you want this to be high, range 0 to 1
technically you can have a negative R^2 if your model is actively destroying information
bias underfitting variance overfitting
classification metrics: accuracy is correct over total
precision is false positive rate
recall is false negative rate
importance is domain specific
